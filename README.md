## 🛠️ Tech Stack

UrbanEye is built with a modern and scalable tech stack.

### **Frontend (Mobile App)**
* **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)**: For building a high-performance, cross-platform mobile application from a single codebase.
* **[Dart](https://dart.dev/)**: The programming language for Flutter.
* **Key Packages**:
    * `firebase_core` & `cloud_firestore`: For direct communication with Firebase.
    * `http`: For making API requests to the backend.
    * `google_maps_flutter`: For displaying interactive maps.
    * `geolocator`: For fetching the device's GPS location.

### **Backend (Server)**
* **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)**: A lightweight Python web framework for our REST API (for processing, notifications, etc.).
* **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: The core language for the backend logic.
* **[Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup)**: For secure communication between the Flask server and Firebase.

### **Database**
* **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Using **Cloud Firestore** for a flexible, scalable NoSQL database and **Firebase Authentication** for user management.


## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Firebase Project**: Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
* **Flutter SDK**: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* A code editor like VS Code or Android Studio.

### **Backend Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Akshit2807/UrbanEye.git](https://github.com/Akshit2807/UrbanEye.git)
    cd UrbanEye/backend  # Navigate to the backend folder
    ```
2.  **Setup Firebase Admin SDK:**
    * In your Firebase project settings, go to `Service accounts`.
    * Click "Generate new private key" and download the JSON file.
    * **Securely** place this file in your backend directory (e.g., as `serviceAccountKey.json`) and add it to your `.gitignore` file to keep it private.
3.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the Flask server:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

### **Frontend Setup**

1.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend # Or your flutter app directory name
    ```
2.  **Configure Firebase for Flutter:**
    * Follow the [FlutterFire installation guide](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview#installation) to connect your Flutter app to your Firebase project. This will involve adding a `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) to your app.
3.  **Get Flutter packages:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
    Connect a device or use an emulator, and the app will build and run.
